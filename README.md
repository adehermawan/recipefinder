## Overview

RecipeFinder - the second redux application in this course! With this course, we learned one way that we can use redux to handle information received from an API. Let’s overview some of the new things we went over in this chapter though.

Quickly though, remember that these section overviews also double as opportunities for you to take coding breaks. So please feel free to take a break and grab a drink, snack, or meal - whatever you need to stay energized while coding and learning!

 As a brief overview, here are some of the main concepts we covered in RecipeFinder:

Web Requests allow us to fetch information from APIs in order to dynamically grab data from the web.

Ternary Expressions are particularly helpful for adding conditional rendering logic to our components based on state or props data.

The React-router-dom library allows us to create routes within our application to map specific components to urls within our app.

This includes the BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, and Link components.

 Also, if you want to extend this application, here’s a couple challenges to continue coding RecipeFinder:

Change the switching of favorited items to be saved in the redux store, so that even on reloads of the same recipe, you can’t re-favorite them.

Delete favorite items from your favorite recipes list.

Have a banner message appear every item an item is favorited.

Add localStorage through this library: https://github.com/15Dkatz/sfcookies, to store favorite items so that they are saved on a reload of the application.
